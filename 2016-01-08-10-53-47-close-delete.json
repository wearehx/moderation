There's quite a few more stringent ways of moderating join requests, FB gives a lot of information about friends in the group, whether they were added by someone, what groups they're a member of already, how old the account is etc on a join request. It's pretty easy (if sometimes time consuming) to determine if a member request is relevant. Not perfect always, but you can build out a bit of a process. \nAnd yep, nothing wrong with deleting inappropriate threads after they've come and gone.",
