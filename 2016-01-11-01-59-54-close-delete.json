We should have first established the Jokes & Memes section (https://github.com/wearehx/policies/blob/content-policy/content-policy.md#jokes-and-memes) before determining that this post was out of bounds.\n\nIt seems arbitrary that this joke was closed. Especially because the content policy also mentions nothing about drugs or drug paraphernalia. \n\nI think until there is a section on jokes and memes they shouldn't really be closed. Within reason of course.",
